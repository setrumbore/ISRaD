## What is ISRad?
ISRad is an open source, community-developed, database for soil radiocarbon data. Our goals are:
	1) to enhance the availability and use of soil radiocarbon data;
	2) to provide a dynamic respository for researchers to contribute their radiocarbon data;  
	3) to include not only bulk radiocarbon, but also measurements of organic matter fractions, heterotrophic respiration, interstitial gases, and surface fluxes 

## History

ISRaD has been developed in collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.

## Community

The data in ISRaD will regularly be ingested into other global soils databases.  Currently we have a collaboration ISCN, the International Soil Carbon Network

## Publications
ISRaD was built from the efforts begun groups who started to put together bulk radiocarbon data. ISRaD fixes a number of issues and adds new data to both data sets.
